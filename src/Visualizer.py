"""todo:

create visualizer class
object is like a ProblemSetting object

main recieves bool for Visualize

load np array of all polygonalpaths

access outputfile by index

this class uses:
list of clusters - use VECTOR FIELD and CURVE (could get just the index to plot from input file - avoid reduntant aligned points from tesselation)

from object - must compute position from barycentric coordinates
from file - must normalize coordinate to grid
